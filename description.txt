NEW UPDATE 1.6
-Added Config to set the kills needed per level and the max level you can reach 
-The actual max level is still 20, you can just limit your max bonuses by selecting a lower level cap

Banner Boost is an RPG mod of sorts that powers you up against enemies as you defeat more of them.
Every 50 (by default) Kills lets you take reduced damage and deal more damage to them.
At the max level of 20, you are totally immune to them and always kill them in one hit.
